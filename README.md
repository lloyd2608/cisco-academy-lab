# 🚀 Cisco Networking Academy Lab - [Lab Title Here]

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains my write-up and insights from a hands-on lab completed through **Cisco Networking Academy**. The lab focuses on building practical skills in networking and cybersecurity by working directly with tools like Wireshark, Packet Tracer, and terminal-based commands.

## 🧪 Lab Topic
**[Insert a short lab topic, e.g., Exploring DNS Traffic, Configuring Firewalls, Packet Tracer Simulation, etc.]**

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of [insert topic]
- Use industry tools to capture, simulate, or analyze network behavior
- Identify and interpret real-world data from network traffic
- Strengthen cybersecurity and networking troubleshooting skills

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer / Wireshark / Linux Terminal *(choose based on the lab)*
- Networking protocols: [e.g., DNS, TCP/IP, ARP, ICMP]

## 📝 What I Did
- [✔️ Captured packets using Wireshark / Configured routers / Simulated attacks...]
- [✔️ Analyzed DNS queries and responses / Built and tested a network topology...]
- [✔️ Identified potential security issues or misconfigurations...]
